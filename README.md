# deploy_cowrie_mhn

This script will deploy Cowrie SSH honeypot on Modern Honey Network as a Kippo sensor.

You install a default MHN server and add the custom script.

Cowrie is a  medium interaction SSH honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and the shell interaction performed by the attacker.
Cowrie is developed by Michel Oosterhof and is based on Kippo by Upi Tamminen (desaster).

There is also a fork of MHN with cowrie integrated as a new sensor type .

If you prefer to user the official MHN repo and want to add quick cowrie as sensor this script can be used.
